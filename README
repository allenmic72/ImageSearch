Spims File

The spims file is located in the build directory and is 
allset to be used like:

To Make Spims File
-------------

Make sure the parser location declaration (located at the top of the 
ImageSearch.py file) is correct. The one already there should work on 
CCIS linux boxes. Then, make sure the file has execution permissions and 
rename the file to "spims".
