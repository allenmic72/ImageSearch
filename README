Example Usage with spims file
-------------

./spims -p TestImages/morning.png -s TestImages/morning.png

Spims File
-------------

The spims file is located in the build directory and is allset to be used like:

./spims -p path/to/pattern/image.jpg -s path/to/source/image.jpg

OR

To Make Spims File
-------------

Make sure the parser location declaration (located at the top of the ImageSearch.py file) 
is correct. The one already there should work on CCIS linux boxes. Then, make sure the file
has execution permissions and rename the file to "spims". Run the program like the following 
example

./spims -p TestImages/morning.png -s TestImages/morning.png
